## About This Piece:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In ancient Egyptian mythology, the sun god Ra sailed through the sky in boats called solar barques. The pharaoh, thought to be the earthly vessel of the sun god, travels on this ship into the underworld on their journey to the afterlife, protecting Ra and his the solar barque from Apophis, a great serpent who seeks to destroy Ra's boat and thus return the universe to a state of entropic chaos.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This piece depicts the dangerous journey to the underworld on the solar barque as an unbearably bright, overtly animated adventure, in which peril is confronted with brazen courage.
