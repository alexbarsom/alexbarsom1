## About This Piece:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This piece expresses a common, nevertheless painful experience many people go through, of falling out of touch with someone who was once close to you. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first movement plays with sporadic energy and a driving, anticipatory rhythmic character. This is accompanied by a muddy, spectrally opposed harmonic language.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second movement presents awkward, churning, conflicting rhythms and drastic, dissonant swells of intensity.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third and final movement is bleak, vast, cold and spacious. This movement becomes spectrally sound and harmonically clear as the piece dulls and fades out of existence.
