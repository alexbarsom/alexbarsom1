## About This Piece:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a woman of color, Georgia Douglas Johnson faced a myriad of adversities, which she beautifully paints an image of herself transcending in this short poem. However, the lack of specificity of the poem allows it to invoke a powerful, universal feeling of freedom from the oppressive weight of one's personal hardships.

## Poem:


When I rise up above the earth,<br>
And look down on the things that fetter me,<br>
I beat my wings upon the air,<br>
Or tranquil lie,<br>

Surge after surge of potent strength<br>
Like incense comes to me<br>
When I rise up above the earth<br>
And look down upon the things that fetter me.
