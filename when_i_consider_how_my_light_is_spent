## About This Piece:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This piece was inspired by John Milton's poem of the same name, in which he confronts the tragic loss of his sight in the middle of his life. A devout Protestant, Milton believed that, although his blindness would impede his ability to honor his God-given talent for writing, he was still able to serve God through his faith. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the text from the first and last lines in isolation conveys a stark image of shock and confusion caused by the sudden loss of sight. Without the closure that Milton provides in his complete poem, we lack reassurance and are immersed instead in the same void Milton would have physically experienced. We are left to simply feel a sense of loss and draw from it our own conclusions. Should we be able to find clarity and acceptance as easily as Milton does in the wake of profound loss?
