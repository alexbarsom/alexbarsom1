Alex’s pieces have also won him recognition in both national and international competitions - he received third place in the Metropolitan Youth Orchestra’s emerging composer competition and an honorable mention in the Musica Prospettiva call for scores, along with other composers born on or after 2000, and his music was selected for a concert performance and recording by the Yarn/Wire ensemble.</p>

These experiences have allowed him to hone his craft, gain valuable experience working with professional musicians and ensembles, and see his music come to fruition in concert and in professional recordings.
