<h1> Bio </h1>

<p class="tab two">Alex Barsom is a Coptic-American composer whose music synthesizes disparate influences to create a representation of his lived experience. As such, he finds the voice to be a potent device for narrative music which allows him to reconcile with his own intersectional identity.</p> 

<p class="tab two">Alex’s pieces have won recognition in national and international competitions, such as the Metropolitan Youth Orchestra’s Emerging Composer competition and Soli Chamber Ensemble’s 30x30x30 Project.  Additionally, his vocal music has been selected as a finalist for Chelsea Hollow’s call for scores, earned him a place in programs such as N.E.O. Voice Festival, and has garnered commissions from numerous emerging vocalists, including Michelle Rice, Carmen Edano, and Finn Sagal.  He has had the opportunity to collaborate with renowned artists such as JACK Quartet, Orchestra Senzaspine and the Carpe Diem Quartet at Chigiana Academy, Yarn/Wire Ensemble, pianist Jihye Chang, the Delgani String Quartet, Quatuor Diotima, and Aperture Duo.</p>

<p class="tab two">Alex is pursuing a Master’s degree in composition with Christopher Cerrone at Mannes College of Music. He earned his Bachelor’s degree at UCLA, where he studied primarily with Richard Danielpour, along with Kay Rhie, David Lefkowitz and Ian Krouse.</p>
