## About This Piece:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often, a sense of foreboding and one of positive anticipation can be hard to differentiate, and very frequently the patterns and events in our lives influence whether we assume the best or the worst in a moment of anxious anticipation. As this piece carries forward, it leads the listener to wonder whether its conclusion will be joyous, dreadful, or somewhere in between.
