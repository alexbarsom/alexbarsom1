## About This Piece:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspired by a moving poem written by Christina Rossetti, this piece explores feelings of loneliness and longing. With a primarily octatonic harmonic language and largely contrapuntal piano texture, I searched for ways to color the octatonic collection to give it more character, both by adding notes outside of the collection and by exploring non-functional tonal harmonic ideas which can be derived from it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found the most dramatic section of the poem to be the second half of the first stanza, which I reflected by setting it at the climax of the piece. Although I prefer to keep the order of a text as the author left it, this especially powerful section felt necessary to reiterate when set to music.

## Poem:
Somewhere or other there must surely be<br>
The face not seen, the voice not heard,<br>
The heart that not yet—never yet—ah me!<br>
Made answer to my word.<br>
<br>
Somewhere or other, may be near or far;<br>
Past land and sea, clean out of sight;<br>
Beyond the wandering moon, beyond the star<br>
That tracks her night by night.<br>
<br>
Somewhere or other, may be far or near;<br>
With just a wall, a hedge, between;<br>
With just the last leaves of the dying year<br>
Fallen on a turf grown green.<br>
