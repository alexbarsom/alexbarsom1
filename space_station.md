## About This Piece:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The choir functions in an atypical manner, as instead of having any text into which it might breathe music, it instead only serves to color the poem that the narrator speaks in its entirety. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The poet, Tom Sleigh, paints such intense and relatable human drama in an elegant manner, but sets it in a different universe. The narrative occurs in, and because of a foreign, eerie environment which beautifully serves the underlying drama of the poem. The unique narrative of this imaginative text struck me in such a familiar, yet novel way that I felt compelled to set it to music, and reflect these aspects of the text in the piece which it would inspire.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Setting a poem to be spoken by a narrator over a choir, although not the default choice for most when composing choral music, is not all too unheard of. However, in congruence with the frothy, veiled textures and harmonies of the choir, a musical landscape emerges which propels us into the unknown, with a thread of  familiarity sewn by the spoken word of the narrator and its close, directional relationship with the music.

## Poem:

(Note: a space station generates gravity by revolving one way and then another. When it reverses direction to revolve the other way, there are several moments when gravity is suspended.)

My mother and I and the dog were floating<br>
Weightless in the kitchen. Silverware<br>
Hovered above the table. Napkins drifted<br>
Just below the ceiling. The dead who had been crushed<br>
By gravity were free to move about the room,<br>
To take their place at supper, lift a fork, knife, spoon—<br>
A spoon, knife, fork that, outside this moment's weightlessness,<br>
Would have been immovable as mountains.<br>

My mother and I and the dog were orbiting<br>
In the void that follows after happiness<br>
Of an intimate gesture: Her hand stroking the dog's head<br>
And the dog looking up, expectant, into her eyes:<br>
The beast gaze so direct and alienly concerned<br>
To have its stare returned; the human gaze<br>
That forgets, for a moment, that it sees<br>
What it's seeing and simply, fervently, sees...<br>

But only for a moment. Only for a moment were my mother<br>
And the dog looking at each other not mother<br>
Or dog but that look—I couldn't help but think,<br>
If only I were a dog, or Mother was,<br>
Then that intimate gesture, this happiness passing<br>
Could last forever...such a vain, hopeless wish<br>
I was wishing; I knew it and didn't know it<br>
Just as my mother knew she was my mother<br>

And didn't...and as for the dog, her large black pupils,<br>
Fixed on my mother's faintly smiling face,<br>
Seemed to contain a drop of the void<br>
We were all suspended in; though only a dog<br>
Who chews a ragged rawhide chew toy shaped<br>
Into a bone, femur or cannonbone<br>
Of the heavy body that we no longer labored<br>
To lift against the miles-deep air pressing<br>

Us to our chairs. The dog pricked her ears,<br>
Sensing a dead one approaching. Crossing the kitchen,<br>
My father was moving with the clumsy gestures<br>
Of a man in a space suit—the strangeness of death<br>
Moving among the living—though the world<br>
Was floating with a lightness that made us<br>
Feel we were phantoms: I don't know<br>
If my mother saw him—he didn't look at her<br>

When he too put his hand on the dog's head<br>
And the dog turned its eyes from her stare to his...<br>
And then the moment on its axis reversed,<br>
The kitchen spun us the other way round<br>
And pressed heavy hands down on our shoulders<br>
So that my father sank into the carpet,<br>
My mother rested her chin on her hand<br>
And let her other hand slide off the dog's head,<br>

Her knuckles bent in a kind of torment<br>
Of moonscape erosion, ridging up into<br>
Peaks giving way to seamed plains<br>
With names like The Sea of Tranquility<br>
—Though nothing but a metaphor for how<br>
I saw her hand, her empty, still strong hand<br>
Dangling all alone in the infinite space<br>
Between the carpet and the neon-lit ceiling.<br>
