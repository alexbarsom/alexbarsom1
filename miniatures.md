## About This Piece:

This set of miniatures acts as a somewhat exploratory composition, as it was an attempt to compose serial music; a task which has both challenged me and stretched my creative imagination. This piece is fundamentally based upon two rows, however, in an untraditional manner, the row presented the left hand does not proceed strictly in order without interruptions caused by repetitions in earlier sections of the row.
I find that myserial music differs quite drastically from that of other music, as I am presented very clearly with an initial bit of material. Whereas I often find myself searching for the seed which underlies my other compositions, I am instead coaxing continuing material out of a very clear seed, which I am deliberately planting before the composition even begins. Although this process is challenging in its unfamiliarity, it rewards me with a more holistic approach to my composition process, as I am forced to change the way I think about - and therefore work with - my music.
