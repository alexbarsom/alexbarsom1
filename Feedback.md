## About This Piece:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that AI is only discussed in existential terms. Conversation always tends towards speculation over whether it will be the salvation or damnation of humanity. This presupposes that AI will become an unwieldy, unfathomable power as it absorbs our collective capabilities. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This premise, however, fails to consider the incapability of humanity that created and trains this technology. These errors find their way into the programming of AI as well as the data on which it is trained, leading to nonsensical outputs and blatant misinformation or logical failures. When chatgpt hallucinates false information, or when other AI models entirely fail due to undiscerning training with poor data leading to outputs that are consistently incorrect, it reveals another potential future for this exciting new technology; we may live in a world where this technology never surpasses us, and instead it provides wonderful, yet specific, conveniences for us, rather than revolutionary change. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece represents the limitations of AI, specifically, the way in which it can crash and burn. The music evokes the sound of a positive feedback loop of erroneous information which grows into overwhelming and indiscernible noise and chaos. A cannon in the piano accompanies an ever intensifying vocal line, and with the damper pedal down the entire piece and the cannon occuring in the low range of the piano, the resonance quickly becomes overwhelming as we are swallowed by a wall of sound. I hope to show through how the voice - an instrument wedded to our humanity - the piano, and electronics interact, that AI is inevitably quite human, and therefore it is inevitably quite limited.
