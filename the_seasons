## About This Piece:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This song cycle can begin on any song and continue in chronological order from there. Since the seasons of nature parallel stages of love, each choice of a starting point tells a different story through the same collection of songs.
