## About This Piece:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ianthe is the euphonic, discreet pseudonym that Walter Savage Landor gave to his unattainable love, Jane Sophia Swift. Though she would marry other people, only crossing the poet's path a few more times before her death, Landor pines for her unapologetically, giving the poem a quality not often seen in contemporary texts. The language that Landor uses does not shy away from the carnal urges he feels, but instead leans into them freely, even elevating them to sacrality for the joy they bring him. Such an unusual inversion and glorification of lust drew me to this text. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The name "Ianthe" comes from Greek mythology - Ianthe was an oceanid, one of 3,000 sea-nymphs who were the daughters of the Titan Oceanus and his sister Tethys. Oceanids served many functions, as they were nurturing mothers, personifications of springs and water, and even important goddesses in their own right. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mythological element of the text inspired the instrumentation and timbral world of this song. I chose a combination of opaque winds and sensitive strings which would allow for exploitation of the most delicate, yet ethereal, ensemble sounds, as well as the most shrill and shrieking cries. In addition, each instrument has, on its own, the capability to accompany, double, and ornament the voice, along with the capacity to perform individual vocalistic lines.
