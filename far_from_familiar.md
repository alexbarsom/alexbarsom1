## About This Piece:

While abroad during my first year of college, I found that writing this piece, contrary to its title, acted as a sort of lullaby for me. The music largely exists in an impressionistic, yet post-tonal realm which feels familiar to me and close to my heart. As I was longing for the comfort, and even at times, the stasis of home, while surrounded by that which was turbulent and unfamiliar, composing this piece gave me a bit of home to grasp onto while I was away.
