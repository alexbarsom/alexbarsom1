## About This Piece:

### I. Prelude and Fugue in C “Kites and Darts” - duration c. 3'30"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inspiration for this piece came from a fascinating mathematical discovery made by Sir Roger Penrose, who found sets of just two shapes which could tile a plane infinitely and aperiodically. One pair of shapes have been nicknamed kites and darts, as they vaguely resemble those objects in the real world. Just as these tiles fit together to cover the plane in no exactly repeating pattern, so too do the two contrasting motifs which comprise the prelude and fugue subject fit together throughout the piece, but never quite in the same way.

### II. Toccata and Fugue in C - duration c. 2' 30"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rapid figurations and quickly repeated notes in the toccata allow the performer to demonstrate their technical prowess, while the uneven meter and fluctuating beat groupings allude to the rhythmic characteristics of the fugue.

### III. Prelude and Fugue “Decompose” - duration c. 2'15"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This piece attempts to deconstruct the concept of a prelude and fugue as it progresses. Two voices are prominently featured drifting in and out of phase in the prelude, foreshadowing the two-voice fugue to follow. In the fugue, the two voices are stratified from each other in range and rhythmic motion, while the subject which is pulled apart and fragmented until it becomes imperceptible. Although the integral fugal element, the subject, is slowly “decomposed,” the fugue still retains some of its defining characteristics; the two voices fly to and from each other, while quasi-cadences and veiled appearances of the subject remind the listener of its traditional form and structure.
