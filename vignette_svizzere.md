## About This Piece:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This set of pieces was inspired by three locations across Switzerland of which I have diverse and fond memories. I allowed both my personal experience in these picturesque places, as well as their unique histories, to inform my compositions. History especially informed my composition of both the Gandria and Poschiavo vignettes, with Gandria being a city with a rich history of trade, production and even smuggling, and Poschiavo being a rural area with a diverse alpine foodscape and a well-preserved traditional culture. "Sorengo Laghetto," however, was informed mostly by my personal experience, as it is the beautiful lake around which I would take my morning walks and runs during the year that I lived just a quarter mile away from this beautiful landscape. I therefore feel a strong personal and emotional connection to these pieces, as they serve as a nostalgic personal reminder of all the wondrous experiences I had during my year abroad in Switzerland. I hope, however,that I may also convey and share with the audience a sense of the same majesty which I
was fortunate enough to enjoy.
